# data structures
The main purpose of this package is to practice some of the classical data structures in computer science.

All the implementations are optimized for **readability** more than performance... again this was only intended to be used to study

## usage
import as any other module with the following statement:
```python
# example...
from data_structures import avl
```

# tests
There is included a `tests.py` file using the standard `unittest` to check the correctness of the data structures

Test with the following command, on **this** directory:
```bash
python3 -m unittest -v tests.py
```

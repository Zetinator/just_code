This is a repository to practice some problem solving abilities for coding interviews.

# tests
There is included a `tests.py` file using the standard `unittest` to check the correctness of the data structures and algorithms...

Test with the following command, on **./python** directory:
```bash
python3 -m unittest -v tests.py
```
